## Welcome to the FAIR-MI Github

### Rationale

üåç Microorganisms from multiple taxonomic domains engage in intermicrobial interactions to form communities in all biomes. 
ü¶† Even with identical community members, these complex interactions can vary in time, space and due to changes in abiotic factors.
üß∞ The range of *in silico*, *in vitro* or *in vivo* methods used to study these interactions is equally wide, and all of them produce a large amount of data.

‚û°Ô∏è However, **there is no standard to report intermicrobial interactions** and a dire need for an open access platform to datasets that support this evidence!

### Why FAIR-MI?

This organization is a way to gather initiatives that pave the way towards Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Representations of Microbial Interactions (MI).

Together as a community, we can develop *Minimum Information about Intermicrobial Interaction Data* (MIIID; pronounced `/miÀêd/` like ['mead'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead)).

### Contact and further resources

üì´ If you have questions, feel free to contact Alan (`apacheco [AT] biol.ethz.ch`) or Charlie (`cpauvert [AT] ukaachen.de`). If you have technical questions regarding the MIIID schema or want to join the Github organisation, please contact Charlie (`cpauvert [AT] ukaachen.de`).

We explained the need for FAIR-MI and MIIID in our Perspective paper:

We showcased a way to describe and validate interaction data in our poster:
